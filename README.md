# Norys Ndachule â€“ Website Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio, built entirely with HTML and CSS.

I'm Norys Ndachule, a medical student passionate about the intersection of healthcare and technology. This portfolio is a creative space where I showcase who I am, what I do, and where I'm headed.

## About the Project

This project represents my journey through medicine, tech, and design. The site features a futuristic medical themeâ€”complete with heartbeat animations, glowing panels, and responsive layoutsâ€”all built without any JavaScript. Itâ€™s a clean, interactive experience meant to reflect both my personality and professional aspirations.

Inside, youâ€™ll find:
- A brief overview of my background and interests  
- A skills section highlighting both technical and medical proficiencies  
- A timeline of my academic and career milestones  
- Featured projects (like "Treebute") that reflect my coding journey  
- A contact section with links to get in touch or connect professionally

## Why I Built This

I wanted a digital space that feels both personal and professionalâ€”something that brings together my passion for medicine and my growing curiosity in technology, especially AI in healthcare. This project is as much a learning experiment as it is a personal statement.
